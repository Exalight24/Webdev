<h2>
	About me
</h2>

<p>
I've been a photographer for 13 years, starting when I was 13. I've always loved being able to create and express myself through photography, and this love of creativity has branched out into all parts of my life. 
</p>
<!--sperated the 2 paragraphs here to give them both space-->
<p>
I joined Thinkful to be able to take my creative mindset and apply it to something more practical and useful. I will always love photography, but with the skills I'll learn here I feel I can really make a difference in the world.
