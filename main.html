<h2>
	Hello, I'm Brandon Neer
</h2>

<p>
	I'm a software developer and photographer from St. Louis, Missouri.
</p>

<p>
	As an artistic minded developer, I prioritize:
    
    	<ul>
        <li>Visually pleasing, professional looking websites.</li>
        <li>Well organzied, easy to read code.</li>
        <li>Working with a great team.</li>
        </ul>
</p>

<h2>
	About me
</h2>

<p>
I've been a photographer for 13 years, starting when I was 13. I've always loved being able to create and express myself through photography, and this love of creativity has branched out into all parts of my life. 
</p>

<p>
I joined Thinkful to be able to take my creative mindset and apply it to something more practical and useful. I will always love photography, but with the skills I'll learn here I feel I can really make a difference in the world.
</p>
